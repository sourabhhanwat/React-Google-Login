# React-Google-Login
Add Google Sign-In and Sign-Out to your React App
First use npm to install create-react-app package then we can create a new React App simply.

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app app

cd app

npm start

Before you integrate Google Sign-In into your website, 
you should create a client ID, which you need to call the sign-in API. 
So we should visit https://console.developers.google.com/ and create our project and copy the Client ID

install: npm install react-google-login
